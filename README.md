## what?

[nrm](https://github.com/seekrs/nrm) is a [norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette/tree/master/norminette) wrapper that simply aims to prettify your `norminette` calls.

## features

- prettier output (objectively so)
  - spinner
  - colors
  - trims norm errors if there are more than `20`
- timeout support
  - norminette won't try parsing a file for more than `2` seconds
- single python3 file
  - don't like some messages? wanna change some values around? go ahead and hack your way into it

## license

this project is published into the public domain.  
it's a ~250-ish line script filled with shitty code, who would care?
